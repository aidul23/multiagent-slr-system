We present a simple but effective approach for utilizing a pretrained transformer, which infers the target class by predicting multiple question-answering tasks and combining the outcomes. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed method for social science research questions by analyzing positive and negative opinions between political entities in two major events: 2016 U.S. presidential election and COVID-19.

IT has also been flooded with immense amounts of data, which is being published every minute of every day, by millions of users, in the shape of comments, blogs, news sharing through blogs, social media micro-blogging websites and many more. Manual traversal of such huge data is a challenging job; thus, sophisticated methods are acquired to perform this task automatically and efficiently. News reports events that comprise of emotions \u2013 good, bad, neutral. Sentiment analysis is utilized to investigate human emotions (i.e., sentiments) present in textual information.

            "abstract": "Software development support tools have been studied for a long time, with recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. These models can generate Python code for data science and machine learning applications. LLMs are helpful for software engineers because they increase productivity in daily work. An LLM can also serve as a \u201cmentor\u201d for inexperienced software developers, and be a viable learning support. High-quality code generation with LLMs can also be beneficial in geospatial data science. However, this domain poses different challenges, and code generation LLMs are typically not evaluated on geospatial tasks. Here, we show how we constructed an evaluation benchmark for code generation models, based on a selection of geospatial tasks. We categorised geospatial tasks based on their complexity and required tools. Then, we created a dataset with tasks that test model capabilities in spatial reasoning, spatial data processing, and geospatial tools usage. The dataset consists of specific coding problems that were manually created for high quality. For every problem, we proposed a set of test scenarios that make it possible to automatically check the generated code for correctness. In addition, we tested a selection of existing code generation LLMs for code generation in the geospatial domain. We share our dataset and reproducible evaluation code on a public GitHub repository, arguing that this can serve as an evaluation benchmark for new LLMs in the future. Our dataset will hopefully contribute to the development new models capable of solving geospatial coding tasks with high accuracy. These models will enable the creation of coding assistants tailored for geospatial applications.",

            "abstract": "Being one of the most widely used social media tools, Twitter is seen as an important source of information for acquiring people\u2019s attitudes, emotions, views and feedbacks. Within this context, Twitter sentiment analysis techniques were developed to decide whether textual tweets express a positive or negative opinion. In contrast to lower classification performance of traditional algorithms, deep learning models, including Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), have achieved a significant result in sentiment analysis. Although CNN can extract high-level local features efficiently by using convolutional layer and max-pooling layer, it cannot effectively learn sequence of correlations. On the other hand, Bi-LSTM uses two LSTM directions to improve the contexts available to deep learning algorithms, but Bi-LSTM cannot extract local features in a parallel way. Therefore, applying a single CNN or single Bi-LSTM for sentiment analysis cannot achieve the optimal classification result. An integrating structure of CNN and Bi-LSTM model is proposed in this study. ConvBiLSTM is implemented; a word embedding model which converts tweets into numerical values, CNN layer receives feature embedding as input and produces smaller dimension of features, and the Bi-LSTM model takes the input from the CNN layer and produces classification result. Word2Vec and GloVe were distinctly applied to observe the impact of the word embedding result on the proposed model. ConvBiLSTM was applied with retrieved Tweets and SST-2 datasets. ConvBiLSTM model with Word2Vec on retrieved Tweets dataset outperformed the other models with 91.13% accuracy.",

Aims: Create a benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the title-abstract screening process of SRs. Provide evidence whether using LLMs in title-abstract screening in software engineering is advisable. Method: We start with 169 SR research artifacts and find 24 of those to be suitable for inclusion in the dataset. Using the dataset we benchmark title-abstract screening using 9 LLMs. Results: We present the SESR-Eval (Software Engineering Systematic Review Evaluation) dataset containing 34,528 labeled primary studies, sourced from 24 secondary studies published in software engineering (SE) journals. Most LLMs performed similarly and the differences in screening accuracy between secondary studies are greater than differences between LLMs. The cost of using an LLM is relatively low \u2013 less than $40 per secondary study even for the most expensive model. Conclusions: Our benchmark enables monitoring AI performance in the screening task of SRs in software engineering. At present, LLMs are not yet recommended for automating the title-abstract screening process, since accuracy varies widely across secondary studies, and no LLM managed a high recall with reasonable precision. In future, we plan to investigate factors that influence LLM screening performance between studies.",

Recently, deep neural network (DNN) models have been used for sentiment analysis tasks, achieving promising results. Although these models can analyze sequences of arbitrary length, utilizing them in the feature extraction layer of a DNN increases the dimensionality of the feature space. More recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved a promising performance in different NLP tasks. However, previous models cannot be transferred to a large corpus and neglect the heterogeneity of textual graphs. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a new Transformer-based graph convolutional network for heterogeneous graphs called Sentiment Transformer Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to model the sentiment corpus as a heterogeneous graph and learn document and word embeddings using the proposed sentiment graph transformer neural network. In addition, our model offers an easy mechanism to fuse node positional information for graph datasets using Laplacian eigenvectors. Extensive experiments on four standard datasets show that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models.",

A realistic assessment of the situation is necessary to utilize resources optimally and appropriately. In this research, we perform Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach. Identification of Covid-19 sentiments from tweets would allow informed decisions for better handling the current pandemic situation. The used dataset is extracted from Twitter using IDs as provided by the IEEE data port. Tweets are extracted by an in-house built crawler that uses the Tweepy library. The dataset is cleaned using the preprocessing techniques and sentiments are extracted using the TextBlob library. The contribution of this work is the performance evaluation of various machine learning classifiers using our proposed feature set. This set is formed by concatenating the bag-of-words and the term frequency-inverse document frequency. Tweets are classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Performance of classifiers is evaluated on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. For completeness, further investigation is made on the dataset using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture of the deep learning model. The results show that Extra Trees Classifiers outperform all other models by achieving a 0.93 accuracy score using our proposed concatenated features set. The LSTM achieves low accuracy as compared to machine learning classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed feature set, the results are compared with the Vader sentiment analysis technique based on the GloVe feature extraction approach.",

Telemedicine is one of the services that rely heavily on ICTs to enable remote patients to communicate with health care professionals; in this case, the patient communicates with the health care professional for a follow-up or for a consultation about his or her health condition. This communication process is referred to as an e-consultation. In this paper, telemedicine services refer to health care services that use ICTs, which enable patients to share, transfer, and communicate data or information in real time (ie, synchronous) from their home with a care provider\u2014normally a physician\u2014at a clinical site. However, the use of e-consultation services can be positively or negatively influenced by external or internal factors. External factors refer to the environment surrounding the system as well as the system itself, while internal factors refer to user behavior and motivation. Objective: This review aims to investigate the barriers and the facilitators that influence the use of home consultation systems in the health care context. This review also aims to identify the effectiveness of Home Online Health Consultation (HOHC) systems in improving patients\u2019 health as well as their satisfaction with the systems. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review to search for articles\u2014empirical studies\u2014about online health consultation in four digital libraries: Scopus, Association for Computing Machinery, PubMed, and Web of Science. The database search yielded 2518 articles; after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the number of included articles for the final review was 45. A qualitative content analysis was performed to identify barriers and facilitators to HOHC systems, their effectiveness, and patients\u2019 satisfaction with them. Results: The systematic literature review identified several external and internal facilitators and barriers to HOHC systems that were used in the creation of a HOHC framework. The framework consists of four requirements; the framework also consists of 17 facilitators and eight barriers, which were further categorized as internal and external influencers on HOHC.",

Applications and systems are continuously developed based on user change requests and security reasons. To meet the large number of external and internal change needs, various methods such as Agile and DevOps have been developed to support system development. These methods help teams to develop and implement changes quickly and flexibly. The purpose of the study is to examine the role of change management in a constantly changing digital environment, to answer questions such as how continuous change affects users and how organizations can help their employees prepare for continuous change. The theoretical part of the work explores the different phases of software development and the benefits of DevOps. Four change management theories are presented, and user resistance to systems and changes, as well as change readiness, are discussed from the perspective of software development. The empirical research analyzes responses from semi-structured interviews and compares the results to the collected theory. The results support previous research on the subject and highlight best practices recommended for use in companies and organizations. The study clearly shows that companies should support their employees in a constantly changing environment, allowing them to trust their own skills to learn new things and minimize the feeling of uncertainty. Change management should have a greater role in DevOps and software development in general, which could reduce employee stress, train employees to prepare for changes, and increase work efficiency.",

PeerTrust model has two main features. First, we introduce three basic trust parameters and two adaptive factors in computing trustworthiness of peers, namely, feedback a peer receives from other peers, the total number of transactions a peer performs, the credibility of the feedback sources, transaction context factor, and the community context factor. Second, we define a general trust metric to combine these parameters.

This effect can be caused by either excessive or reduced mental workload. Thus, estimating workload levels can help isolate sources that affect performance. Several techniques can be used to measure operator workload. Psychophysiological measurements using electroencephalograms (EEGs) have been used with much success. However, EEG machines are not the most portable, practical, or ubiquitous devices, which constrains their usefulness in experiments. Obtaining physiological mental workload data is a nontrivial task, and there has been a large amount of work on designing lightweight and portable workload measuring devices (Kramer, 1991). Workload assessment techniques should possess the following properties: sensitivity, diagnostic capabilities, selectivity, low intrusiveness, reliability, and ease of implementation (Eggemeier, 1988). The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) has been shown to meet these criteria (Rubio, D\u00edaz, Mart\u00edn, & Puente, 2004). It is a subjective workload assessment technique that relies on a multidimensional construct to derive an overall workload score based on a weighted average of ratings on six subscales: mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration level. The use of these six subscales to compute an overall workload score has been found to reduce variability among subjects, relative to a unidimensional workload rating, while providing diagnostic information about workload sources (Hart & Staveland, 1988). Specific sources of mental workload imposed by different tasks are an important determinant of workload experiences. Three of the subscales relate to the demands imposed on the subject (mental, physical, and temporal demand), whereas the other subscales focus on the interaction of the subject with the task (performance, effort, and frustration level). Descriptions of the six subscales are shown in the Appendix. Thus, the NASA TLX combines subscale ratings that are weighted according to their subjective importance to subjects for a specific task.",

            "abstract": "Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers enable AI applications to connect to external systems in a plug-and-play manner, but their rapid proliferation also introduces severe security risks. Unlike mature software ecosystems with rigorous vetting, MCP servers still lack standardized review mechanisms, giving adversaries opportunities to distribute malicious implementations. Despite this pressing risk, the security implications of MCP servers remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study that treats MCP servers as active threat actors and decomposes them into core components to examine how adversarial developers can implant malicious intent. Specifically, we investigate three research questions: (i) what types of attacks malicious MCP servers can launch, (ii) how vulnerable MCP hosts and Large Language Models (LLMs) are to these attacks, and (iii) how feasible it is to carry out MCP server attacks in practice. Our study proposes a component-based taxonomy comprising twelve attack categories. For each category, we develop Proof-of-Concept (PoC) servers and demonstrate their effectiveness across diverse real-world host\u2013LLM settings. We further show that attackers can generate large numbers of malicious servers at virtually no cost. We then test state-of-the-art scanners on the generated servers and found that existing detection approaches are insufficient. These findings highlight that malicious MCP servers are easy to implement, difficult to detect with current tools, and capable of causing concrete damage to AI agent systems. Addressing this threat requires coordinated efforts among protocol designers, host developers, LLM providers, and end users to build a more secure and resilient MCP ecosystem.",

The reliability and generalizability of the findings heavily depend on the quality of the information mineable from publicly available datasets of vulnerabilities as well as on the availability and suitability of those databases. In this paper, we seek to understand the anatomy of the currently available vulnerability databases through a systematic mapping study where we analyze (1) what are the popular vulnerability databases adopted; (2) what are the goals for adoption; (3) what are the other sources of information adopted; (4) what are the methods and techniques; (5) which tools are proposed. An improved understanding of these aspects might not only allow researchers to take informed decisions on the databases to consider when doing research but also practitioners to establish reliable sources of information to inform their security policies and standards.",

In response to this challenge, this doctoral research proposal aims to explore innovative solutions by focusing on the deployment of agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform software maintenance tasks. The iterative nature of agents, which allows for continuous learning and adaptation, can help surpass common challenges in code generation. One distinct challenge is the last-mile problems, errors at the final stage of producing functionally and contextually relevant code. Furthermore, this project aims to surpass the inherent limitations of current LLMs in source code through a collaborative framework where agents can correct and learn from each other\u2019s errors. We aim to use the iterative feedback in these systems to further fine-tune the LLMs underlying the agents, becoming better aligned to the task of automated software improvement.

Although current training methods, particularly post-training, excel at solving competitive programming problems, they fail to adequately prepare models for the complexities of practical software development. This misalignment raises the critical question: Are existing alignment training methods well suited for real-world software engineering tasks? In this study, we identify this issue and propose SEAlign, a novel alignment framework designed to bridge the gap between code generation models and real-world software development tasks. SEAlign leverages the unique characteristics of software engineering processes, including high-quality workflow steps, to enhance model capabilities. Our framework further employs Monte Carlo Tree Search for fine-grained alignment in multi-step decision processes, followed by preference optimization on critical actions to ensure models meet real-world requirements. We evaluate SEAlign on three standard agentic benchmarks for real-world software engineering, including HumanEvalFix, SWE-Bench-Lite, and SWE-Bench-Verified. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with minimal training overhead. In addition, we develop an agent-based software development platform using SEAlign, which successfully automates the creation of several small applications. Human evaluations of these applications highlight significant improvements in both task performance and user experience. Our findings underscore the potential of SEAlign to accelerate the adoption of large code models in real-world software development.

Recent efforts extend LLMs into multi-agent systems (MAS) that emulate collaborative development workflows, but these systems often fail due to three core deficiencies: under-specification, coordination misalignment, and inappropriate verification, arising from the absence of foundational SE structuring principles. This paper introduces Software Engineering Multi-Agent Protocol (SEMAP), a protocol-layer methodology that instantiates three core SE design principles for multi-agent LLMs: (1) explicit behavioral contract modeling, (2) structured messaging, and (3) lifecycle-guided execution with verification, and is implemented atop Google\u2019s Agent-to-Agent (A2A) infrastructure. Empirical evaluation using the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST) framework demonstrates that SEMAP effectively reduces failures across different SE tasks. In code development, it achieves up to a 69.6% reduction in total failures for function-level development and 56.7% for deployment-level development. For vulnerability detection, SEMAP reduces failure counts by up to 47.4% on Python tasks and 28.2% on C/C++ tasks.",

To tackle this challenge, we propose Self-Organized multi-Agent framework (SoA), a novel multi-agent framework that enables the scalable and efficient generation and optimization of large-scale code. In SoA, self-organized agents operate independently to generate and modify code components while seamlessly collaborating to construct the overall codebase. A key feature of our framework is the automatic multiplication of agents based on problem complexity, allowing for dynamic scalability. This enables the overall code volume to be increased indefinitely according to the number of agents, while the amount of code managed by each agent remains constant. We evaluate SoA on the HumanEval benchmark and demonstrate that, compared to a single-agent system, each agent in SoA handles significantly less code, yet the overall generated code is substantially greater. Moreover, SoA surpasses the powerful single-agent baseline by 5% in terms of Pass@1 accuracy.",

In this context, people have begun to explore a method that leverages multi-agent systems based on LLMs to carry out software development. However, existing research tends to rigidly fix the software development process in a framework in code form, thus failing to dynamically adjust the software development process in real-time to meet the more flexible and variable software environment. In this paper, we propose a dynamic process generation framework, named ToP (Think-on-Process). The core idea of ToP is to leverage experiential knowledge (i.e., process models) to guide LLMs in generating software development processes (i.e., instances). These instances will guide multi-agent in software development and employ a compiler to provide feedback on the development outcomes. Subsequently, we utilize heuristic algorithms to filter the instances and apply process mining algorithms to derive process model. Finally, the process model will be converted into text, formatted as prompts, to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate other instances. Experiments demonstrate that our framework ToP significantly enhances the dynamic process generation capability of the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for five categories of software development tasks.",

The Planner agent first decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication, and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while mitigating single-agent limitations.

Research has explored their role within development teams, focusing on specific tasks such as artifact generation, decision-making support, and information retrieval. Despite the growing body of work on LLMs in software engineering, most studies have centered on broad adoption trends, neglecting the nuanced relationship between individual cognitive and behavioral factors and their impact on task-specific adoption. While factors such as perceived effort and performance expectancy have been explored at a general level, their influence on distinct software engineering tasks remains underexamined. This gap hinders the development of tailored LLM-based systems (e.g., Generative AI Agents) that align with engineers\u2019 specific needs and limits the ability of team leaders to devise effective strategies for fostering LLM adoption in targeted workflows. This study bridges this gap by surveying N = 188 software engineers to test the relationship between individual attributes related to technology adoption and LLM adoption across five key tasks, using structural equation modeling (SEM). The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was applied to characterize individual adoption behaviors. The findings reveal that task-specific adoption is influenced by distinct factors, some of which negatively impact adoption when considered in isolation, underscoring the complexity of LLM integration in software engineering. To support effective adoption, this article provides actionable recommendations, such as seamlessly integrating LLMs into existing development environments and encouraging peer-driven knowledge sharing to enhance information retrieval.",

Additionally, AI can be exclusionary, failing to support diverse users adequately, further exacerbating these concerns. One such aspect of diversity is cognitive diversity\u2014variations in users\u2019 cognitive styles\u2014that leads to divergence in interaction styles. When an individual\u2019s cognitive styles are unsupported, it creates additional barriers to technology adoption. Thus, to design tools that developers trust, we must first understand what factors affect their trust and intentions to use these tools in practice? We developed a theoretical model of factors influencing trust and adoption intentions towards genAI through a large-scale survey with developers (N=238) at GitHub and Microsoft. Using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), we found that genAI\u2019s system/output quality, functional value, and goal maintenance significantly influence developers\u2019 trust, which along with their cognitive styles, affects their intentions to use these tools in work. An Importance-Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA) identified factors that, despite their strong influence, underperform, revealing specific genAI aspects that need design prioritization. We bolster these findings by qualitatively analyzing developers\u2019 perceived challenges and risks of genAI usage to uncover why these gaps persist in development contexts. For genAI to indeed be a true productivity aid, it must align with developers\u2019 goals, maintain contextual transparency, and provide equitable interaction support.

Objective: The present work aims to provide an overview of studies related to time pressure in software engineering; specifically, existing definitions, possible causes, and metrics relevant to time pressure were collected, and a mapping of the studies to software processes and approaches was performed. Moreover, we synthesize results of existing quantitative studies on the effects of time pressure on software development, and offer practical takeaways for practitioners and researchers, based on empirical evidence. Method: Our search strategy examined 5,414 sources, found through repository searches and snowballing. Applying inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in the selection of 102 papers, which made relevant contributions related to time pressure in software engineering. Results: The majority of high quality studies report increased productivity and decreased quality under time pressure. The most frequent categories of studies focus on quality assurance, cost estimation, and process simulation. It appears that time pressure is usually caused by errors in cost estimation. The effect of time pressure is most often identified during software quality assurance. Conclusions: The majority of empirical studies report increased productivity under time pressure, while the most cost estimation and process simulation models assume that compressing the schedule increases the total needed hours. We also find evidence of the mediating effect of knowledge on the effects of time pressure, and that tight deadlines impact tasks with an algorithmic nature more severely. Future research should better contextualize quantitative studies to account for the existing conflicting results and to provide an understanding of situations when time pressure is either beneficial or harmful.",

Finally, issues regarding workflow integration and specialized user interfaces are proved further.

The emerging prowess of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising avenue to address these complexities.

Drawing from our insights into variable usage conventions in Linux, we enhance path analysis using post-constraint guidance. This approach, combined with our methodically crafted procedures, empowers LLift to adeptly handle the challenges of bug-specific modeling, extensive codebases, and the unpredictable nature of LLMs. Our real-world evaluations identified four previously undiscovered UBI bugs in the mainstream Linux kernel, which the Linux community has acknowledged.

            "abstract": "Safety testing serves as the fundamental pillar for the development of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). To ensure the safety of ADSs, it is paramount to generate a diverse range of safety-critical test scenarios. While existing ADS practitioners primarily focus on reproducing real-world traffic accidents in simulation environments to create test scenarios, it\u2019s essential to highlight that many of these accidents do not directly result in safety violations for ADSs due to the differences between human driving and autonomous driving. More importantly, we observe that some accident-free real-world scenarios can not only lead to misbehaviors in ADSs but also be leveraged for the generation of ADS violations during simulation testing. Therefore, it is of significant importance to discover safety violations of ADSs from routine traffic scenarios (i.e., non-crash scenarios) to ensure the safety of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). We introduce LEADE, a novel methodology to achieve the above goal. It automatically generates abstract and concrete scenarios from real-traffic videos. Then it optimizes these scenarios to search for safety violations of the ADS in semantically consistent scenarios where human-driving worked safely. Specifically, LEADE enhances the ability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to accurately construct abstract scenarios from traffic videos and generate concrete scenarios by multi-modal few-shot Chain of Thought (CoT). Based on them, LEADE assesses and increases the behavior differences between the ego vehicle (i.e., the vehicle connected to the ADS under test) and human-driving in semantic equivalent scenarios (here equivalent semantics means that each participant in test scenarios has the same abstract behaviors as those observed in the original real traffic scenarios). We implement and evaluate LEADE on the industrial-grade Level-4 ADS, Apollo. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art ADS scenario generation approaches, LEADE can accurately generate test scenarios from traffic videos, and effectively discover more types of safety violations of Apollo in test scenarios with the same semantics of accident-free traffic scenarios.",

Although the viewpoint disparity between ground and overhead images makes cross-view geolocalization challenging, significant progress has been made assuming that the ground agent has access to a panoramic camera. For example, our prior work (WAG) introduced changes in search area discretization, training loss, and particle filter weighting that enabled city-scale panoramic cross-view geolocalization. However, panoramic cameras are not widely used in existing robotic platforms due to their complexity and cost. Non-panoramic cross-view geolocalization is more applicable for robotics, but is also more challenging. This paper presents Restricted FOV Wide-Area Geolocalization (ReWAG), a cross-view geolocalization approach that generalizes WAG for use with standard, non-panoramic ground cameras by creating pose-aware embeddings and providing a strategy to incorporate particle pose into the Siamese network. ReWAG is a neural network and particle filter system that is able to globally localize a mobile agent in a GPS-denied environment with only odometry and a 90\u00b0 FOV camera, achieving similar localization accuracy as what WAG achieved with a panoramic camera and improving localization accuracy by a factor of 100 compared to a baseline vision transformer (ViT) approach.",

This paper shows that by using an off-the-shelf high-definition satellite image as a ready-to-use map, we are able to achieve cross-view vehicle localization up to a satisfactory accuracy, providing a cheaper and more practical way for localization. While the utilization of satellite imagery for cross-view localization is an established concept, the conventional methodology focuses primarily on image retrieval. This paper introduces a novel approach to cross-view localization that departs from the conventional image retrieval method. Specifically, our method develops (1) a Geometric-align Feature Extractor (GaFE) that leverages measured 3D points to bridge the geometric gap between ground and overhead views, (2) a Pose Aware Branch (PAB) adopting a triplet loss to encourage pose-aware feature extraction, and (3) a Recursive Pose Refine Branch (RPRB) using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm to align the initial pose towards the true vehicle pose iteratively. Our method is validated on KITTI and Ford Multi-AV Seasonal datasets as ground view and Google Maps as the satellite view. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method in cross-view localization with median spatial and angular errors within 1 meter and 1\u00b0, respectively.",

Specifically, the semantic segmentation model named LineNet is proposed, for skyline extractions from query images, which has proven to be robust to a variety of complex natural environments. On the aforementioned benchmarks, the fully automatic method is elaborated for large-scale cross-modal localization using panoramic skyline images. Finally, the compound index is delicately designed to reduce the storage space of the positioning global descriptors and improve the retrieval efficiency.

The proposed framework is a two-stage pipeline that uses a query image and digital elevation model (DEM) data as input. The authors frame automatic geo-localization without GNSS recordings as a skyline matching problem. By extracting the skyline from the DEM data and query images, the query image can be localized by matching the query skyline feature to the DEM skyline database. It has been demonstrated that this low-cost approach can perform efficiently in mountainous or hilly areas to produce reliable localization results.

At the heart of the localisation is the fundamental task of discovering feature correspondences between recorded and live images.

This latter point, which is the main focus of our paper, requires understanding how and why the appearance of visual features can change over time. In particular, such knowledge allows us to better deal with abrupt and challenging changes in lighting. We show how by instantiating a parallel image processing stream which operates on illumination-invariant images, we can substantially improve the performance of an outdoor visual navigation system.

In this paper, we present a new approach to visual navigation under changing conditions dubbed SeqSLAM. Instead of calculating the single location most likely given a current image, our approach calculates the best candidate matching location within every local navigation sequence. Localization is then achieved by recognizing coherent sequences of these \u201clocal best matches\u201d. This approach removes the need for global matching performance by the vision front-end \u2013 instead it must only pick the best match within any short sequence of images. The approach is applicable over environment changes that render traditional feature-based techniques ineffective. Using two car-mounted camera datasets we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and compare it to one of the most successful feature-based SLAM algorithms, FAB-MAP. The perceptual change in the datasets is extreme; repeated traverses through environments during the day and then in the middle of the night, at times separated by months or years and in opposite seasons, and in clear weather and extremely heavy rain. While the feature-based method fails, the sequence-based algorithm is able to match trajectory segments at 100% precision with recall rates of up to 60%.",

Nowadays, we have seen a lot of sensor-rich vehicles (e.g. Robo-taxi) driving on the street autonomously, which rely on high-accurate sensors (e.g. Lidar and RTK GPS) and high-resolution map. However, low-cost production cars cannot afford such high expenses on sensors and maps. How to reduce costs? How do sensor-rich vehicles benefit low-cost cars? In this paper, we proposed a light-weight localization solution, which relies on low-cost cameras and compact visual semantic maps. The map is easily produced and updated by sensor-rich vehicles in a crowd-sourced way. Specifically, the map consists of several semantic elements, such as lane line, crosswalk, ground sign, and stop line on the road surface. We introduce the whole framework of on-vehicle mapping, on-cloud maintenance, and user-end localization. The map data is collected and preprocessed on vehicles. Then, the crowd-sourced data is uploaded to a cloud server. The mass data from multiple vehicles are merged on the cloud so that the semantic map is updated in time. Finally, the semantic map is compressed and distributed to production cars, which use this map for localization. We validate the performance of the proposed map in real-world experiments and compare it against other algorithms. The average size of the semantic map is 36 kb/km. We highlight that this framework is a reliable and practical localization solution for autonomous driving.",

To alleviate traffic and increase mobility, AI-powered traffic management systems examine real-time data collected from cameras, sensors, and linked vehicles using computer vision and machine learning. Furthermore, public utilities and smart grids can benefit from improved resource allocation, predictive maintenance, and dynamic load balancing. Urban living standards, environmental impact, and economic savings have all been shown to improve significantly significantly in case studies of smart around the world. This study presents a new model for object identification in vehicles called a deep learning-based single-shot multi-box detector (SSD) to recommend an improved inception network that maximizes SSD and improves the small object feature extraction (FEA) of the shallow network. The second is to improve the fusion effect by modifying feature pyramid network. Then, deep feature fusion module enhances the deep network\u2019s FEA. The research model incorporates improved version of sea horse optimization (MSHOA), which enhances classification accuracy, to fine-tune the parameters of the suggested model. Utilizing video footage captured by a closed-circuit television (CCTV) system on roadways in Tashkent, empirical findings demonstrate that the suggested model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by around 98.1%.",

            "abstract": "Energy efficiency has become a critical concern in modern software development, particularly for applications deployed in resource-constrained environments such as IoT, mobile devices, and cloud infrastructure. Traditional static analysis tools and single-model code review solutions fail to provide timely, adaptive, and context aware recommendations, leading to suboptimal energy performance and increased technical debt. This paper introduces a novel adaptive multi-agent AI framework that delivers real-time, personalized energy optimization feedback directly within the software development workflow. The proposed system leverages transformer-based code embeddings for semantic analysis, a FAISS-powered contextual memory for historical learning, and a collaborative multi-agent system consisting of specialized AI agents for energy profiling, compliance monitoring, resource allocation, and maintainability assessment. Adaptive reinforcement learning dynamically refines energy recommendations based on developer interactions, ensuring continuous improvement over time. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the framework effectively reduces redundant feedback, improves system-wide energy efficiency, and enhances developer trust through explainable AI techniques. The results highlight the potential of integrating intelligent, energy-efficient coding practices into modern software engineering workflows, fostering sustainability without compromising performance.",

However, these AI models have high computational demands, and thus high energy consumption, limiting scalability in power-constrained environments. This paper systematically addresses energy optimization in real-time video inference by exploring energy-performance trade-offs with sophisticated AI models, i.e., YOLOv8 and MobileNet. A variety of techniques, such as model pruning, quantization, and hardware-aware optimizations, were stringently evaluated. Experimental results indicate that model pruning resulted in a reduction in energy expenditure by up to 35% without compromising detection accuracy to 92%. Moreover, quantization resulted in a further energy saving by 18% and improved inference acceleration by 25% with minimal reduction in accuracy. Moreover, reducing frame rates from 30 frames per second (FPS) to 15 FPS resulted in a power reduction by 40% with a mere reduction in detection performance by 3%. Benchmarking across different hardware setups showed that power savings by optimized lightweight models running in edge devices were by as much as 50% compared to GPUs. These results highlight feasible directions for energy efficient AI system design in real-time video applications, which prove to be particularly useful in edge computing and Internet of Things environments.",

            "abstract": "The fourth industrial revolution, termed Industry 4.0, offers a vital and valuable opportunity to drive social and technological innovations. It has state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems and related technological architecture, which can drastically increase a firm's productivity and innovation performance. Nevertheless, Industry 4.0 is also significantly shortening the product life cycles and demanding the pace of innovation to be accelerated. A firm, however, cannot accelerate the pace of its innovation by exclusively relying only on its internal resources. This is the reason firms are increasingly adopting open innovation strategy through collaboration with external stakeholders. The critical challenge that firms are facing while managing open innovation is trust among the stakeholders. Digital trust, attained through Industry 4.0 technologies, can play an instrumental role in promoting open innovation. Against this backdrop, the present study investigates the impact of digital trust on open innovation performance. The study investigates the role of technological orientation and technological absorption capacity in the association between digital trust and open innovation. Cross-country data of 324 electrical and electronics firms of three major Asia-Pacific countries, namely Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, were collected using a close-ended questionnaire. The study employed partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and PLS-multi group analysis (PLS-MGA) to analyze the modeled relationships. The results reveal that digital trust, composed of trust and Industry 4.0 technologies, has a significant positive impact on a firm's open innovation. Likewise, results also depict a strongly positive moderating role of technological orientation in the association between digital trust and open innovation. Finally, results also exhibit a significant mediating role of both potential and realized technological absorptive capacities in the association of digital trust and open innovation. It is the first-ever study discussing the linkage of digital trust with open innovation. The findings of this study suggest development of technology strategy to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies for accelerating the pace of open innovation.",

However, the societal impact of eco-design packaging remains limited due to a lack of summary work focusing on knowledge creation, evaluation, and application. This knowledge construction issue calls for systematic review through an epistemological perspective. Drawing on the systematic reviews of 261 articles, this research aims to assess the literature that focuses on eco-design, packaging, and eco-design packaging through three perspectives (i.e., positivism, interpretivism, and transformative consumer research (TCR)) to delineate the state of the art of previous research, and then, to propose a transformative research agenda for greater social awareness, research use, and social bene\ufb01t. This research provides an in-depth understanding of the role of eco-design packaging for social well-being through the lens of positivism, interpretivism, and TCR. The \ufb01ndings reveal that TCR is deemed as a more suitable way to conduct research in terms of improving the societal impact of eco-design packaging. The authors highlight three avenues for maximizing the social bene\ufb01ts of eco-design packaging by investigating its role in three social challenges: (1) The relationship between new technology and consumers\u2019 vulnerability; (2) sustainability; and (3) public health.

The literature indicates several difficulties in obtaining success in the development of SPSS offers.

The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is worldwide recognized by its potential to systematically solve contradictions and generate innovations. However, the research framework available and its application into SPSS domain are still very limited. Thus, to address this gap, this paper aims to explore the contributions and challenges of the adoption of TRIZ in the development of SPSSs. A systematic literature review of the foundations and advances in this topic was conducted. The primary results indicate the main contributions from TRIZ to SPSS development, the types of eco-innovations resulting, the artifacts (e.g. models, methods, proposition or instantiation) that applied TRIZ towards SPSS and the most frequent category of PSS resulting according to TRIZ. Findings suggest that the systematic innovation proposed by TRIZ has great potential to enable the development of systematic SPSS offers. Synergies between TRIZ and the sustainable strategies of Cleaner Production also were mapped. Finally, our study proposes a research agenda and indicate the main challenges to apply the TRIZ in SPSS models.",

The circular economy is gradually acknowledged as promising to attain ecological growth by minimising resource input, waste, emissions and energy loss. This article investigates the environmental efficacy of circular value creation and its implications for business models and supply chain strategies. It intends to incorporate CBM and CSCM for sustainable innovation and ecological growth, relying on a review of the literature and four case analyses. The context identifies five distinct CBM propelling supply chain strategies and sustainable innovation, supply chain loops, which differ in intricacy and worth. The study demonstrates that circular business models (CBM) and circular CSCM models can facilitate organisations in accomplishing ecological objectives. The companies examined in the study have different characteristics, but all face comparable challenges in persuading consumers and suppliers to adopt circular business models and supply chain management. A significant challenge is that customers perceive products made from recycled or remanufactured materials as inferior to traditional products, leading to lower prices despite meeting comparable quality standards. Therefore, we review the current literature on the business model background to technological, organisational and social innovation. Since the existing literature does not provide a general conceptual definition of sustainable innovation and circular business mode for circular supply chain management, we present normative examples of requirements that circular business models should meet to support sustainable innovation.

They also need to develop a clear understanding of sustainable business strategies and how long-term value is created and driven through innovation and the deployment of resources. In addition, we find that boards can assess and monitor ways to measure and manage long-term value creators and drivers and encourage their companies to become involved in the circular economy with its $4.5 trillion investment opportunities. Future research could use case studies and board interviews to investigate boards of directors\u2019 practices and performance, concerning how boards have helped develop strategies and procedures to facilitate this new finance focus on long-term sustainable value creation.",

            "abstract": "With global awareness of sustainable development continuing to rise, stakeholders of all parties are concerned about companies revealing the substance of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The standard for evaluating a company's success is no longer limited to the single indicator of financial performance but also includes the company\u2019s sustainability practices. In this paper we have adopted decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) to identify the key factors affecting an enterprise\u2019s ability to achieve sustainable development. Based on a literature review, we have grouped 11 criteria for defining sustainable development into the following three categories: sustainable manufacturing, corporate performance, and external pressure. By evaluating the interrelationships among these criteria, we can determine the significance of each criterion and causality relative to the others. The results indicate that eco-design, laws and regulations, and waste management are the three most important factors influencing a company\u2019s ability to achieve sustainable development. Identifying causality between the criteria enables enterprises to develop or improve their environmental policies to achieve better corporate performance, strengthen their competitive advantages, and realize companies\u2019 sustainable development goals.",

A systematic literature review of factors that influence decision-making for strategy development has been applied in this research. To determine the external factors that influence strategic decision-making for universities nowadays there has been chosen a structure from the PESTLE analysis. The systematic literature review was limited to only higher education factor analysis. Based on the literature review, the authors have developed an approach for strategic direction evaluation and ongoing key performance indicator analysis. The approach is based on the Importance-Performance Matrix\u2013IPA and developed further to include a comprehensive analysis of the strategic directions, organizational sources, and capabilities. An assessment of the university\u2019s main strategic priorities with influencing factor analysis can be done using the developed approach adapted by the authors. It integrates the principles of resource-based strategy, key stakeholder engagement and creating shared value in the strategy development process. The adapted method was used in the 3rd generation university strategy development. The research contributes to the literature on a systematic approach development in the strategy evaluation process. This article puts emphasis on the resource-based view and key stakeholder involvement in the evaluation process.",

However, manufacturing companies need help in adopting these practices due to differences between industries, the need for research and development, and variations in corporate sizes. Objectives: This analysis aims to study sustainability practices and their impact on corporate performance across different industries. It seeks to identify whether there is a relationship between sustainability practices and corporate performance in manufacturing companies and if the type of industry affects this relationship. Methods/Approach: To achieve this goal, a multivariate analysis was conducted using hierarchical regression. Results: The research indicates a direct connection between sustainability practices and corporate performance. It highlights the importance of creating distinctive sustainability practices that cater to the specific needs and characteristics of each industry. Conclusions: Developing corporate strategies around sustainability is imperative. Additionally, public policies should be implemented to encourage the adoption of such practices, reinforcing the need for industry-specific approaches to enhance both sustainability and corporate performance.",

            "abstract": "In response to greater environmental awareness among stakeholders, companies have become increasingly interested in practices such as eco-innovation. Despite the expanding literature on eco-innovation, scholars have so far paid little attention to the study of eco-innovation and its impact on business sustainability, particularly considering the mediating effect of service innovation capability. To fill this research gap, this study extends the concepts of green business by investigating an original conceptual framework, which proposes that the capacity for service innovation has a mediating effect on the relationship between sustainable organizational performance and environmental innovation. This conceptual framework is subjected to empirical testing, implemented through a survey involving 95 Malaysian firms which use green technology. Data is collected through both postal and online questionnaires and analyzed through structural equation modeling using partial least squares. Respondents for this paper were identified using the directories of MyHijau (2013) and the Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation, 2014. The results suggest that: (1) eco-innovations unlock better sustainable performance; (2) service innovation capability has a partially significant positive mediating effect; (3) service innovation capability ultimately benefits companies by allowing them to differentiate through an emphasis on value creation; (4) service capability can also act as a business strategy to create barriers to new entry by competitors. Thus, eco-innovation and service innovation capability tend to represent significant intangible resources and enable an organization to achieve long-term objectives, competitive advantage and business sustainability. To date, this is the first study relating eco-innovation, service innovation capability and sustainability performance in the Malaysian corporate context and using a specific sample of companies that make use of green technologies.",

Several publications on this field have been published since 2014, nevertheless, there is still a lack of understanding on the process of CBMI, particularly for incumbent firms; and, as most of the literature is theoretical, further empirical insights are required. Furthermore, there is a need for an updated and comprehensive review of this fast-paced field, and a need to further integrate the CBMI field with the conventional Business Model Innovation (BMI) domain.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is also a core digital technology that can create innovative, sustainable, comprehensive, and resilient environments. ESG- and AI-based digital transformation is a relevant strategy for managing business value and sustainability in corporate green management operations. Therefore, this study examines how corporate sustainability relates to ESG- and AI-based digital transformation. Furthermore, it confirms the moderating effect of green innovation on the process of increasing sustainability. To achieve the purpose of this study, 359 data points collected for hypothesis testing were used for statistical analysis and for mobile business platform users. The following conclusions are drawn. (1) ESG activities have become key variables that enable sustainable corporate growth. Companies can implement eco-friendly operating processes through ESG activities. (2) This study verifies the relationship between AI-based digital transformation and corporate sustainability and confirms that digital transformation positively affects corporate sustainability. In addition, societal problems can be identified and environmental accidents prevented through technological innovation. (3) This study does not verify the positive moderating effect of green innovation; however, it emphasizes its necessity and importance. Although green innovation improves performance only in the long term, it is a key factor for companies pursuing sustainable growth. This study reveals that ESG- and AI-based digital transformation is an important tool for promoting corporate sustainability, broadening the literature in related fields and providing insights for corporate management and government policymakers to advance corporate sustainability.",

            "abstract": "Widespread adoption of sustainable and circular business models is required to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable society, however, the literature supporting the process of Business Model Innovation for the Circular Economy - or Circular Business Model Innovation (CBMI) - is currently emerging. Several publications on this field have been published since 2014, nevertheless, there is still a lack of understanding on the process of CBMI, particularly for incumbent firms; and, as most of the literature is theoretical, further empirical insights are required. Furthermore, there is a need for an updated and comprehensive review of this fast-paced field, and a need to further integrate the CBMI field with the conventional Business Model Innovation (BMI) domain. The present research aims to first, map and frame the field of CBMI, building upon the structure of the conventional BMI field; second, to assess the current state of research of the field, proposing a future research agenda; and third, to explore the most relevant elements of the CBMI process in the practice. The article uses a combined literature and multiple case study approach. It begins by synthesizing a BMI framework, which is then combined with the findings of a systematic literature review (n = 84) on the emergent CBMI field, to propose an original framework that structures the field. The review includes an assessment per article on the state-of-research. The framework is then illustrated through a multiple case study on ten incumbent firms that have implemented a substantial CBMI, revealing which topics are more relevant from a practice perspective and offering valuable empirical insights. We suggest that future research should prioritize those topics that are very important from the practice and still un- or under-researched.",

The circular economy is gradually acknowledged as promising to attain ecological growth by minimising resource input, waste, emissions and energy loss. This article investigates the environmental efficacy of circular value creation and its implications for business models and supply chain strategies. It intends to incorporate CBM and CSCM for sustainable innovation and ecological growth, relying on a review of the literature and four case analyses. The context identifies five distinct CBM propelling supply chain strategies and sustainable innovation, supply chain loops, which differ in intricacy and worth. The study demonstrates that circular business models (CBM) and circular CSCM models can facilitate organisations in accomplishing ecological objectives. The companies examined in the study have different characteristics, but all face comparable challenges in persuading consumers and suppliers to adopt circular business models and supply chain management. A significant challenge is that customers perceive products made from recycled or remanufactured materials as inferior to traditional products, leading to lower prices despite meeting comparable quality standards. Therefore, we review the current literature on the business model background to technological, organisational and social innovation. Since the existing literature does not provide a general conceptual definition of sustainable innovation and circular business mode for circular supply chain management, we present normative examples of requirements that circular business models should meet to support sustainable innovation. Finally, we outline the research agenda by asking some guiding questions.",

It explores the \u2018eco-design paradox\u2019, which emphasizes the tension between the need for flexible design and the availability of data required for assessing environmental impacts during early innovation stages. This paradox presents a challenge: the lack of detailed data can have an impact on the ability to make sustainable optimal design decisions as designs are still fluid. The study investigates the essential sustainability aspects to be evaluated in the initial phases of innovation and explores the involvement of decision-makers and entrepreneurs in the sustainability assessment process. The paper uses a robust action research methodology to examine various eco-innovation diagnostic tools in collaboration with two French Institutes of Technology (FITs). A comparative analysis is conducted to assess these tools\u2019 efficacity in evaluating several dimensions of sustainability, including environmental, social, and economic aspects. Our investigation identifies key criteria that are crucial for early-stage sustainability assessments, such as innovation description, systemic vision, functionality, and stakeholder involvement. The findings will guide policy makers, researchers, and practitioners in the field of eco-innovation by providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating and promoting sustainable innovations in their early stages. The insights from our findings show how important expert knowledge is in the eco-innovation diagnostic process. They also demonstrate the need for a more integrated approach to eco-innovation.",

It adopts an exploratory case study method of a large Chinese manufacturing firm operating a traditional product-based business model and three types of PSS business models (i.e. product-, use- and result-oriented PSSs). The supply chain operations of the four distinct business models are analysed and their associated circularities are discussed. The findings show that business models akin to result-oriented PSS, have tighter and more efficient cycles of supply chain operations; which means, the repair, reuse and remanufacturing system is faster and the rate is higher.

In this article, an alternative coherent data envelopment analysis (CoDEA) with a representation of the intramural structure is established for evaluating the efficiency of a sustainable supply chain. The proposed CoDEA model not only maintains the traditional value of data envelopment analysis (DEA) in its \u201cblack box\u201d approach, which avoids the intermediate measures among different nodes in the supply chain, but also overcomes some main pitfalls in previously developed DEA models. The usefulness of the proposed model is illustrated in both simple and complex supply chain situations, yielding reasonable efficiency scores as compared with those from the existing methods. Moreover, the dummy decision-making unit (DMU) introduced in CoDEA offers additional benefits in the scenario of a small supply chain. The approach allows the implicit rule that requires three times the ratio between the total measurement factors and total DMUs to be always satisfied, providing a higher discriminatory power of CoDEA. Based on the case studies covering both simple and complex supply chains, the results and sensitivity analysis ascertain that the proposed CoDEA model is a flexible and reasonable alternative with a good efficiency evaluation, contributing toward an efficient and sustainable supply chain management process pertaining to sustainable strategy or policy recommendations.",

CSC amalgamates the circular economy (CE) thinking into supply chain operations of industry and improves the three sustainability dimensions of the organizational performance. However, manufacturing organizations in developing economies are finding difficult to measure the impact of CSC adoption on organizational performance. Therefore, this research aims to explore the CSC performance measures and to develop a performance measurement framework for assessing the impact of CSC implementation on business organizational performance. This research proposes a modified balanced scorecard (BSC) based hybrid framework of Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (PF-AHP) and Pythagorean fuzzy weighted aggregated sum product assessment (PF-WASPAS) methods. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through an empirical case study of an Indian manufacturing company. Further, the proposed framework is tested with other three Indian manufacturing companies and their results are compared with the case company. The finding reveals that the overall performance of empirical case company is 62.88% based on define set of performance measures and performance of other three companies are 64.51, 56.47, and 52.43%, respectively.

            "abstract": "In the face of rapidly growing sustainability challenges, pressure is mounting on businesses to decouple production from virgin resources, reduce waste and phase-out pollution. The Circular Economy (CE) is important for addressing resource efficiency within the textiles sector. In a CE for textiles, clothes would be used more, made to be recycled, and made from safe and renewable inputs. Textiles-to-textiles (T-T) recycling is a key component of a circular textiles industry yet represents only 1 % of global textiles production. This paper sets out to answer how a closed-loop system for recycling post-consumer textiles (PCT) can be scaled. Whilst T-T recycling is a rapidly emerging industry, there is a lack of clarity on the enabling conditions needed to scale significantly throughout the value chain. By means of semi-structured interviews with practitioners participating in textiles CE activities, a holistic analysis of the barriers and enablers at all stages of the value chain has been conducted. The paper concludes with practical recommendations addressing each T-T supply chain actor. It makes an important contribution to understanding how actors in the circular value chain, policymakers and convening bodies can act in concert to successfully scale a system for collecting and recycling PCT.",

            "abstract": "This study aims to explore a paradigm for using servitization in circular supply chains, with research fields including smart, sustainable supply chains, circular economy, innovation, digital technology, product service systems and sustainability as focal areas. A comprehensive statistical analysis of the literature on servitization, circular economy and smart supply chains reveals the history of the industry, including scholarly work, major concerns and future research prospects. The database for the analysis is provided by Scopus. Consequently, 288 research articles were reviewed, and the research trends of servitization, circular supply chains and smart supply chains from 2014 to 2022 (Q1) were covered. The analysis reconnoitres bibliometric statistics highlighting notable authors, contemporary keywords for sifting through the literature, scientific dimensions related to smart supply chain, servitization and the circular economy, historical growth based on exploration trends and country-by-country investigation of the research field. The study also proposes a conceptual framework that illustrates how a greater emphasis on removing barriers to servitization could increase the efficiency of various circular supply chains. Given this, there is room for further research into the role servitization plays in ensuring long-term sustainability. This paper helps to understand current scholarly publications on servitization, smart supply chains and their significance in the circular economy. It also provides a template to utilize the field\u2019s prior accomplishments as a guide to future research opportunities.",

            "abstract": "In the rise of global emphasis on circular economy, the automotive firms in an emerging economy such as India in this context are bracing themselves for circular supply chain to recover the expended resources after formalization of End-of-life vehicle (ELV) norms, but these firms lack the knowledge about how to transform from Product-Service System (PSS) business model to circular business model. The extant literature doesn\u2019t mention clearly as to what drivers and sub-drivers are needed for adoption of circular principles in PSS business model. This paper aims to propose a multi-theoretical framework (the resource-based view, resource-dependence theory, and stakeholder theory) and identifies and evaluates drivers and sub-drivers. The paper adopts Grey-Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory multi-criteria decision-making method to evaluate the inter-relationship between the sub-drivers. A structural model has been developed based on the outcome of the empirical analysis. The study recommends that firm should focus on the important drivers (sub-drivers) \u2013 Circular Value Marketing (Recovery/Recycling information on a Product), Circular Services (Supplier adaptability for closed resource loop), Circular Product Design (Design of Sustainability Capability), and Reverse Flow Drivers (Incentives in Secondary Market for Recoverable Products). The implications are related to design, sourcing, and marketing functions and suggest the adoption of the influencing drivers and sub-drivers to create circular value. This study contributes to the literature of the circular supply chain by discriminating the causal relationships between factors that would help managers to develop product service systems strategy(s) to create circular value in the supply chain.",

            "abstract": "Servitization is a process adopted by some industries and companies to create competitive advantage and increase the value of physical products by adding services. Manufacturing companies may decide to integrate a product\u2013service system into their activities. However, there is no clear evidence of the effects of servitization on performance or sustainability, particularly in a circular economy. The aim of this study was to assess the potential impact of servitization on sustainability in a sample of 208 European listed manufacturing companies by investigating corporate sustainability disclosure, environmental performance, and policies. Using the business descriptions in the Bloomberg database, we identified two groups of companies: \u201cpure manufacturers\u201d and \u201cnon-pure manufacturers.\u201d We examined potential differences in sustainability between the two groups resulting from servitization. Data were collected for the fiscal year 2016. Our findings suggest that servitization leads to improved energy consumption and therefore enhances environmental performance. However, servitization had no effect on corporate sustainability disclosure and other environmental policies such as environmental assurance, emissions reduction policies, and environmental supply chain management.",

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Following a systematic literature review methodology, the study identified 67 studies and synthesised them using content analysis. Findings \u2013 A conceptual model is developed illustrating how PSS business models impact SCC through increased product longevity, closure of resource loops and resource efficiency. It also identifies six contextual factors affecting the implementation of SCC including: economic attractiveness of SCC; firm sustainability strategy; policy and societal environment; product category; supply chain relationships; and technology. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The conceptual model proposes that SCC increases with servitisation. It also proposes that the main circularity effect stems from increased product longevity, followed by closed resource loops and finally resource efficiency. The model is deduced from the literature by using secondary data. Practical implications \u2013 The review provides practitioners with a framework to increase SCC through PSS business models. It also gives insight into the various contextual factors that may affect how a manufacturer\u2019s servitisation strategy contributes to SCC. Originality/value \u2013 This review contributes to the understanding of the relationship between servitisation and SCC by synthesising the different effects that exist. Moreover, it creates new knowledge by identifying a range of contextual factors affecting the relationship between PSS and SCC.",

This paper used a 13-month, longitudinal, participative Action Research strategy to understand and improve the performance of a German medical technology company that manufactures prostheses with varying levels of customization. The conceptual framework was successfully applied in the case organization. It provided a structure for product segmentation which grouped products according to their value propositions which reflected different trade-offs in terms of health technology assessment (HTA). Appropriate delivery strategies were then determined for each group.

Within the healthcare sector, however, organizational priorities are often directed toward short-term goals and easily accessible resources, and responsibilities relating to sustainable development tend to be disregarded. Due to the complexity of the sustainability concept within the healthcare context, research explicitly focused on this topic remains scarce. This research presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of SOI sustainable healthcare supply chain innovations, revealing current research themes in the field. The content-based conceptual guide analysis identifies the current research and knowledge gaps by analyzing collected literature and developing an understanding of sustainable healthcare supply chain innovations. The findings encompass both technological and organizational practices and models in healthcare. The conceptual guideline for future practices and research is presented through building on two theoretical concepts: circularization and the diffusion of innovation. Furthermore, the SLR reveals potential future research avenues which improve both the practical implementation and theoretical understanding of SOI within the healthcare supply chain.",

This study explores the main themes and concepts related to MedTech start-ups, examines the research methods used, and identifies major gaps in the literature. A scoping literature review was performed by searching the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for publications from 2012 to 2023, focusing on MedTech start-ups in titles, abstracts, and keywords. References were analyzed using the Bibliometrix package in R, and a coupling network analysis was conducted, visualizing results on a Coupling Map to identify key research themes and gaps. The research identified 480 unique articles on MedTech start-ups. After removing duplicates and following a PRISMA-based assessment, 79 articles were included in the review. The studies predominantly focused on organizations, including start-ups and Venture Capital funds (46%). Most articles (60%) used qualitative methods, 25% employed mixed methods, and 15% used quantitative methods. Geographically, 63% of articles focused on a single country, primarily the USA (35%), followed by Iran, Sweden, Switzerland, China, and Japan (2\u20134% each). Coupling analysis identified five topic clusters: crowdfunding for medical research, innovation in medical technology, new product development, digital start-ups, and the venture capital industry. This review highlights the significant role of MedTech start-ups in advancing healthcare innovations despite challenges like regulatory hurdles and high capital requirements. The literature emphasizes the importance of collaboration among universities, industry, and government for successful commercialization. The geographic concentration in the USA indicates a need for more inclusive research. Crowdfunding and venture capital emerge as crucial funding sources, suggesting strategies to mitigate risks and enhance innovation success.",

            "abstract": "Medical devices are instrumental in servicing the healthcare sector and promoting well-being in modern societies. However, their production and use contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, thus causing indirect harm to global health. With a share of approximately 4.4% of global emissions, the healthcare sector exhales CO2 throughout its value chain; sources of this range from direct electricity consumption and water heating in healthcare facilities to the supply chains delivering healthcare services and products. Within this context, the environmental impact of medical devices is present across their production, distribution, usage, and eventual disposal. Each step in the lifecycle of medical devices consumes energy and natural resources, and the end product, after its often single use, is discarded, generating plastic or electronic waste. This study aims to present the key findings from a scoping review of academic research on the topic, which focuses on reducing the environmental impact of medical devices and equipment. The review, conducted according to the PRISMA checklist for scoping reviews, examined 41 studies and categorised them based on the lifecycle stages of medical devices (design and development, manufacturing, usage, and end of life) and the sustainability aspects (economic, environmental, and social).",

Even though there are many sectors with specific needs when it comes to supporting innovation, the medical technology sector is facing several unique challenges that both increases the lead-time from idea to finished product and decreases the number of innovations that are developed. This paper presents a proposed innovation guide that has been developed and evaluated as a support for the innovation process within medical technology research. The guide takes the unique characteristics of the medical technology sector into account and serves as a usable guide for the innovator. The complete guide contains both a structure for the process and a usable web application to support the journey from idea to finished products and services. The paper also includes a new readiness level, Sect. 4.2 to provide support both when developing and determining the readiness for clinical implementation of a medical technology innovation.",

This study aims to draw an overview of gamified mobile apps for sustainable consumption. Following a systematic process, this study analyzes 67 gamified apps\u2019 sustainability approaches and gamification concepts. It was found that (1) sustainable consumption is generally presented as the efficient use of resources to impact the environment positively, rarely addressing societal impacts or economic gains from shifting consumption practices. Other findings include (2) a lack of diversity in gamification characteristics, given the prevalence of direct communication with the user, the absence of virtual identities, and most apps targeting behavior change without attitude change. A potentially problematic design choice is (3) the presence, in some cases, of external rewards that are often contradictory to the message of sustainable consumption as they lead to more consumption. Nonetheless, based on most apps embedding sustainable consumption activities in the gamification concept and having a large number of users, it is possible to conclude that gamification has the potential to motivate shifts in their users\u2019 lifestyles.",

Gameful methodologies have progressively been introduced into strategic planning processes, futures research, and transition studies, offering a powerful input to participatory backcasting processes. As gamification is a novel and impactful way to motivate and engage participants to take action during and after the participatory process, this study develops a framework for practitioners to gamify backcasting processes. Developed through state-of-the-art review of extant corpus as well as two cases of gamified participatory backcasting, the framework elucidates how participatory backcasting processes that include gamification elements designed to address engagement do have an impact on the participants, particularly in terms of the process being a positive, co-creative experience, and offer a good foundation for posterior actions.",

While most existing research focuses on how gamification contributes to engagement and the formation of more sustainable consumption habits, there is little about how their survival is secured. Intervention\u2019s Purpose. Twenty-one SCA creators shared their considerations and experiences managing SCAs, providing valuable insights into the field of gamified sustainable consumption and practical insights for their stakeholders. Methods. Ideal-type and narrative analyses of the interviews unraveled some relevant survival strategies and lessons learned. Results. The creators\u2019 motivation and background play a role in the app\u2019s survival. Their experiences exposed several aspects affecting their gamification strategies and their relevance for the apps, highlighting traps to avoid and opportunities to improve their standing in an increasingly competitive market. Discussion. Most creators shared stories of \u201clearn as you go,\u201d presenting how the flexibility to adjust the apps\u2019 business models rather than the creators\u2019 professional background is a critical success factor. Since their apps represent their understanding of sustainability, SCA creators should find practical and emotional ways to engage their users while considering the objectives of their apps. Conclusion. Awareness of the risks and pitfalls when creating an SCA may not be enough for successfully undertaking this enterprise. The creators should be capable of strategically plan for all the activities that creating and managing an SCA convey even before the app is conceptualized.",

            "abstract": "Economic models of production, coordination, and consumption that are based on circularity have been postulated to remedy many of the ills of economic activity that are detrimental to the environment and all beings in the biosphere, and, more holistically to economic, social, and cultural interactions among individuals and communities. However, several barriers have stopped or slowed down cyclical economic models from being adopted and integrated across different value networks. Changing the methods in how economic activity is coordinated on a global market requires a global will, and while cemented practices cause major friction, so does a lack of human awareness, motivation, engagement, and attitudes for shifting towards more sustainable models of economic coordination where the design of processes, products, services, (re)use, repurposing, repairing, access, and sharing of resources, both tangible and intangible, is maximised. It has been widely postulated that motivational information systems, and chiefly gamification, are able to transform many of the systems, services, and practices towards being able to bring about similar positive experiences, motivation, and attitudinal shifts witnessed in the context of games and game culture. The main inspiration of this development, games, has been shown to bring about cognitive, emotional, social, and motivational benefits; the premise of the use of gamification is based on the ability to translate these benefits to positive changes in motivations, attitudes, and behaviours towards a sustainable praxis. While gamification has been extensively applied and researched throughout several domains of human activities such as in education, health care, consumption, governance and citizen engagement, mobility, business development and enterprise systems, and workplaces, its research and application have been growing perhaps slower in the context of cyclical models of economic coordination, which albeit would hold insurmountable impact potential on net sustainability and resilience.",

As one of the measures to tackle this wicked problem, changing individual consumption patterns is part of the global sustainable development agenda (UN, 1992). A tenet of these efforts consists of developing a better understanding of the role of consumption and how it binds complex issues such as human need satisfaction, environmental protection, well-being, and equity including ethical considerations for decision-making processes that comprise science, technology, businesses, and innovation (Burget et al., 2017; Ransom et al., 2023; Boon et al., 2015). In the current context of \u2018there is an app for that,\u2019 mobile applications come across as an opportunity to bridge existing awareness-action gaps, motivating users to consume differently, coaxing them to lead less wasteful or lifestyles more mindful about their impacts beyond self-satisfaction (Guillen et al., 2021). Many of these apps tend to present gamification, here defined as \u201can intentional process of transforming any activity, system, service, product, or organizational structure into one which affords positive experiences, skills, and practices similar to those afforded by games\u201d (Hamari, 2019:1) in order to better engage users into the sustainable practices enforced and advocated by the apps and their creators. Research about gamification and sustainability highlights mobile applications (Apps) as promising tools to modify individual behavior because of the possibilities they offer to break up routines and inspire reflection, reducing ignorance barriers and enhancing additional motivation (Nghiem and Carrasco, 2016; Ouariachi et al., 2020; D\u2019Arco and Marino, 2022). Considering that sustainable consumption behaviors are about generating impact for living well today while having a future-oriented outlook (Geiger et al., 2018), this study deems sustainable consumption apps (SCA) as mobile applications that aim at enabling individual choices that satisfy needs through different",
