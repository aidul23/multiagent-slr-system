            "title": "A ConvBiLSTM Deep Learning Model-Based Approach for Twitter Sentiment Classification",
            "abstract": "Being one of the most widely used social media tools, Twitter is seen as an important source of information for acquiring people\u2019s attitudes, emotions, views and feedbacks. Within this context, Twitter sentiment analysis techniques were developed to decide whether textual tweets express a positive or negative opinion. In contrast to lower classification performance of traditional algorithms, deep learning models, including Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), have achieved a significant result in sentiment analysis. Although CNN can extract high-level local features efficiently by using convolutional layer and max-pooling layer, it cannot effectively learn sequence of correlations. On the other hand, Bi-LSTM uses two LSTM directions to improve the contexts available to deep learning algorithms, but Bi-LSTM cannot extract local features in a parallel way. Therefore, applying a single CNN or single Bi-LSTM for sentiment analysis cannot achieve the optimal classification result. An integrating structure of CNN and Bi-LSTM model is proposed in this study. ConvBiLSTM is implemented; a word embedding model which converts tweets into numerical values, CNN layer receives feature embedding as input and produces smaller dimension of features, and the Bi-LSTM model takes the input from the CNN layer and produces classification result. Word2Vec and GloVe were distinctly applied to observe the impact of the word embedding result on the proposed model. ConvBiLSTM was applied with retrieved Tweets and SST-2 datasets. ConvBiLSTM model with Word2Vec on retrieved Tweets dataset outperformed the other models with 91.13% accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Sentiment Analysis is an essential research topic in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and has attracted the attention of many researchers in the last few years. Recently, deep neural network (DNN) models have been used for sentiment analysis tasks, achieving promising results. Although these models can analyze sequences of arbitrary length, utilizing them in the feature extraction layer of a DNN increases the dimensionality of the feature space. More recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved a promising performance in different NLP tasks. However, previous models cannot be transferred to a large corpus and neglect the heterogeneity of textual graphs. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a new Transformer-based graph convolutional network for heterogeneous graphs called Sentiment Transformer Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to model the sentiment corpus as a heterogeneous graph and learn document and word embeddings using the proposed sentiment graph transformer neural network. In addition, our model offers an easy mechanism to fuse node positional information for graph datasets using Laplacian eigenvectors. Extensive experiments on four standard datasets show that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models.",
